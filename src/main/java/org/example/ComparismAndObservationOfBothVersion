Both versions of the code provide a solution to the problem of serving pancakes to users within a given time slot.

/**Non-Concurrent Version:**/
Pros:
Simpler implementation without explicit thread management.
Straightforward sequential execution.
Easier to understand and debug.

Cons:
Operates sequentially, potentially resulting in slower execution times for larger scenarios.
Limited concurrency and parallelism.

/**Concurrent Version (Using CompletableFuture):**/
Pros:
Achieves concurrency without using explicit threads or ExecutorServices.
Leverages CompletableFuture to handle asynchronous tasks and parallel execution.
Better performance in scenarios with a larger number of users or longer pancake making and consumption times.
Simplified programming model for handling asynchronous tasks.

Cons:
Slightly more complex implementation compared to the non-concurrent version.
Internal usage of a thread pool (ForkJoinPool) may have implications on resource usage and scalability in certain scenarios.

/**Observations:**/

The non-concurrent version is simpler and easier to understand, making it suitable for smaller and less complex scenarios.
The concurrent version provides better performance and scalability by leveraging CompletableFuture and achieving concurrency.
It is more suitable for larger scenarios with a significant number of users or longer time slots.
The concurrent version introduces additional complexity due to the use of CompletableFuture and synchronization.
However, it provides a higher-level abstraction for handling concurrency and asynchronous tasks, reducing the manual management of threads.
Both versions adhere to the given requirements and provide the desired output.
The choice between the non-concurrent and concurrent versions depends on the specific requirements, scalability needs, and complexity of the application.
For smaller scenarios, the non-concurrent version may suffice, while the concurrent version is more suitable for larger and more demanding scenarios.
